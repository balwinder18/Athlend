          Welcome to <span className="font-semibold ">athlend.com</span>, 
          your trusted platform for convenient and flexible sports ground bookings after 
          school hours. Athlend (operated by A Plus Technologies, GSTIN: 
          <span className="font-mono"> 06GUXPB9356P1ZG</span>) connects local school

          All payments on this site are processed by a secure third-party payment 
          gateway (e.g., Paytm / PhonePe). We only list grounds authorised by the 
          facility owner via a signed partnership agreement and conduct basic safety 
          checks before listing.

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            We solve the common problems of unavailable or underutilized sports grounds 
            by opening up these venues outside school hours. athlend.com offers real-time 
            booking, instant confirmations, and transparent pricing, so players can 
            concentrate on the game rather than logistics. Our platform ensures ground 
            owners get a trusted partner to optimize facility usage, while users enjoy 
            safe and well-maintained playing spaces.
